Retcore Select is a highly versatile and themeable select component designed to fit perfectly into any Flutter application. Whether you need a simple dropdown, a multi-select with custom chips, or a powerful autocomplete field that fetches data from an API, Retcore Select has you covered.

## Key Features

- **Single & Multi-Select**: Seamlessly switch between single and multi-selection modes with a simple boolean flag.
- **Fully Themeable**: Use the built-in `InputDecorator` to style the component like a standard `TextField`, or provide a comprehensive `FlutterSelectTheme` for deep customization of every element.
- **Search & Autocomplete**:
    - **Local Filtering**: Instantly search through a predefined list of options.
    - **Async API Search**: Fetch options from your server with built-in debouncing to prevent excessive API calls.
- **Custom Builders**: Take full control over the UI by providing a custom `chipBuilder` for multi-select values.
- **Professional UX**: Includes floating labels, clearable values, disabled states, and elegant loading indicators out of the box.
- **Lightweight & Performant**: Built with Flutter's best practices to ensure smooth performance.
